								<h2>Forestry Affected Zone Generator</h2>
								<p>I conducted analysis on the AWS data from all the FMUs to identify affected areas 
									across the district. I then built a model to overlay the five required datasets used for 
									stakeholder notification, producing a consolidated output where attribute tables were 
									structured and cleaned for direct use, enabling a much more efficient approach.</p>

								<h2>Hydrological Modelling</h2>
								<p>Using a USGS DEM layer, hydrological modeling was conducted to analyze the Marble Mountains 
									in Northern California. The analysis focused on delineating the stream and drainage network, 
									including connected stream segments and their corresponding watersheds and sub-basins.</p>

								<h2>Multi-Criteria Evaluation Analysis</h2>
								<p>Using various models (following is the output of the Fuzzy Overlay model) to 
									determine areas of Basilicata that are susceptible to badland encroachment.</p>

								<h2>Least Cost Pathway Analysis</h2>
								<p>This map presents a least-cost path analysis model used to identify optimal hiking 
									trails and routes in Yellowstone National Park. The methodology involves a multi-step 
									process that considers several key criteria, including land cover, slope, wolf density, 
									distance to existing campsites and trails, and proximity to roads. The analysis was 
									conducted using the 'Weighted Sum' tool to generate a surface cost raster, followed by 
									the 'Cost Distance' and 'Cost Path' tools to determine and visualize the most efficient 
									routes based on the cumulative travel cost.</p>
								<p>The following maps display the final combined cost surface and the resulting least-cost 
									path between two selected points.</p>

								<h2>Geocoding and Linear Referencing</h2>
								<p>Geocoding is the process of converting descriptive location information such as addresses, 
									postal codes, or place names, into geographic coordinates. It enables the visualization of 
									tabular data on a map, including plotting customer addresses, service locations, or incident reports.</p>
								<p>Linear referencing is a spatial referencing method used to locate features along a linear path 
									like roads, pipelines, or rivers, based on distance measurements from a known starting point. 
									This technique is especially useful for infrastructure analysis, such as identifying maintenance 
									zones or accident locations along highways.</p>
								<p>ModelBuilder can automate the tasks, streamlining the conversion of large datasets into usable 
									geographic points or events. Below are screenshots illustrating the geocoding and linear referencing 
									(of points data) processes.</p>
