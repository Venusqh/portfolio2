								<h2>Digital Field Data Collection Workflow Implementation</h2>
								<p>Supported the transition from paper-based field data collection 
									to a streamlined digital workflow by helping develop and deploy 
									a QuickCapture field collection application. The solution enabled 
									field staff to capture GPS-accurate spatial data using tablets, 
									with records automatically synchronized to ArcGIS Online. This 
									approach improved data accuracy, consistency, and accessibility, 
									supporting permitting, field inspections, and internal review processes.</p>
							
								<h2>Advanced Drone Operations & Aerial Data Processing</h2>
								<p>Hold an Advanced Drone Pilot Certificate, enabling me to conduct complex 
									flight operations in controlled and advanced airspace environments. I 
									am experienced in planning and executing drone missions to collect 
									high-resolution aerial data, as well as processing and integrating 
									drone-derived datasets into GIS workflows. This capability supports 
									applications such as site documentation, mapping, and spatial analysis.</p>

								<h2>Integrated Fieldwork Techniques</h2>
								<p>My field background includes surveying techniques such as GPS/GNSS data 
									capture and total station workflows, alongside ecological field methods 
									including species identification, vegetation and soil sampling, water 
									quality measurements, wildlife observations for environmental data collection. 
									This combined experience allows me to accurately document field conditions, 
									convey technical findings, and ensure field-derived data is effectively 
									integrated into data-based decision-making.</p>
